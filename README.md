Wow I see that SEO has brought you to my page! Or maybe you just followed a lot of links that eventually led you here. 
Well regardless of how you found me, hey! Hope you're having a great day! Let me start by introducing myself.

My name is Christie (she/her) and I love coding! *if you didn't already know from the amount of projects I have here* Let me be more specific; I love helping others through creating softwares or tools by coding, whether that's by bringing joy to their life, increasing their productivity or solving world problems. And that sort of relates to the beginnings of my software engineering journey which I would say is pretty unique. 

### ðŸŒ± How did I get into coding?
Surprisingly *or maybe not surprisingly*, I didn't start by following the traditional path of taking courses in high school or university and eventually working my way up here. My inspirations started way back in Grade 5 when I first moved (*back*) to Canada. 

There was one person in my class that was very smart and always talked about getting "certificates" on learning a programming language, being able to do things like hacking (not seriously of course). Because of that, I also looked into programming and *for some reason*, chose to start with Ruby. To the little me, it seemed similar to english so I thought it was the easiest. It was also partly influenced by having the same name as one of the characters in my favourite cartoon *Jewelpet* at the time. If I remember correctly, I started learning using codecademy. 

HONESTLY, it led me nowhere. Eventually the concepts became tough to me and it seemed like I couldn't make anything out of it and as a kid, visible rewards were the thing we depended on. So unfortunately, I gave up... BUT that's not until I started playing Minecraft **ALOT** *(maybe a bit too much)*. Now I was the weird one out. While everyone is playing survival mode, I would be building houses and redstone contraptions in creative mode. I was also scared of all the mobs, *and maybe still am*. I also dabbled in alot of mods, having a world with more than 150+ mods. Then, one day I thought to myself, "hey wouldn't it be cool if I can make my own mods?". And that's how I started learning Java, again through codecademy first. This time, I had more success, creating basic projects like calculators, guess the english letter games... small things like that. Ngl, I was still not able to fully make a Minecraft mod at that time (this would be around Grade 6-7).

Then, I found a Harry Potter Minecraft Server, Knockturn, and this is where my journey really started to bloom. Luckily, this server was quite small so the community was quite tightly knit together. Because of this, I had the chance to talk to the owner of the server, who is also in charge of all the code that runs on the server. The reason why I stuck with this server out of all the more popular HP servers was the fact that they had a very unique spell-casting feature that made it feel immersive. Actually having to "swish" your wand by looking left right up down and diagonals. 

The real opportunity happened when the owner started this thing called "Dev Trainees" where she would accept around 10 people to "teach" programming to. Now, the way she taught was assigning us readings of a Java book and having us complete assignments which included around 10 questions with theoretical and practical concepts. She would then mark them and give us feedback. Quite honestly, she gave up after maybe 2-3 lessons and offloaded some of the management to me. So now, I would be the one reading ahead and designing questions and marking questions of the rest. This didn't last long because the others became bored or found it difficult to understand harder concepts. I was really the only one that stuck around after that. With this, I ended up taking up projects such as creating plugins for magical objects like the Weasley Clock, or having a fashion shop that enabled users to purchase Harry Potter fashion items (house hats, house scarves, small magical creatures, etc) in a chest-storage like popup inside Minecraft. 

I have to say, there was a HUGE learning curve when I started these projects. I remember one night, sitting in bed and trying to get this one little thing to work. It was one of my most memorable experiences in all my coding journey. I coded until I saw glimpse of light coming from my window. But the thing was, I was so excited that I didn't even feel tired. I completely lost track of time and it was as if time stopped in that moment. It still feels magical to me nowadays and is probably how I knew, coding is something I must do.

### ðŸ¤” So what am I up to nowadays?
Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelors of Science at UBC, majoring in Computer Science *yes very surprising* and a minor in Mathematics. 

Now within Computer Science, the thing that gets my blood boiling the most is talking about Deep Learning. The way neural network mimic neurons in our brain fascinates me and this led me to wonder how accurately can we actually mimic a brain. Within the neuroscience community, there is still much to be explored and we don't know everything about our brains yet but that's a topic for another time. What I want to do with deep learning, is do something called meta-learning I believe. I want to use a neural network to train an model to learn, then unpack the nodes within the net to see HOW it learnt *so basically visualization of a neural network*. This can then translate to how us humans can learn most effectively and efficiently. Now this is just an idea for now but it is what I'm working up towards. So what am I actually doing now?

#### ðŸ˜„ Realistically
Recently, I became very interested in software engineering principles and finally realized the importance and usefulness of it. So I'm applying these principles to see how I can make my personal website better, while also redesigning the entire page *again*. BUT, the goal is to use these principles to make it more evolvable so I don't have to scrap the entire website again and build it from scratch. On my website, I plan to run a blog and also incorporate mini games that can be played on the website so I am also looking into developing APIs to have these systems be more independent. 

At the time of writing this, my website is still using the old version since I'm on the stage of planning the structure and using UML diagrams and state diagrams *for once*. Since it is my first time applying these concepts on a real project, it might take me a while until touching the code.
